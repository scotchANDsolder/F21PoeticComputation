## What is Arduino?
#### From the website [Arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc): *"Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment"*
The Arduino ecosystem consists of 3 parts:
1. [The Hardware](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products): These are usually called 'boards' and they come in many different flavors each with varying features. We wil be using the [Arduino UNO board](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3/?selectedStore=us) board in this class.

2. [The Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Products): To write and upload programs to the board requires the use of the Arduino IDE. Once you download this program you can upload code by connecting your board to your computers using a USB cable.
3. Open Source Community:
