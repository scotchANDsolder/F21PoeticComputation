# Notes on Construction

Your machines can be constructed using many different types of materials
- Metals
- Wood
- Plastics
- Cardboard
- Soft Materials
- Fabrics & Soft circuits



## Using Acrlyics (Plastics)
**Pros**
- Sturdy constructions
- Viable for precision parts like gears
- Easy to manipulate, glue and join

**Cons**
- Need access to a laser cutter
- Requires precision measurement and design
- Difficult to manipulate, glue and join



## Using Cardboard
**Pros**
- Great way to prototype and test ideas
- Cheap and easily accessible material
- Easy to manipulate, glue and join

**Cons**
- Difficult to get precision (but this might not be a downside)
- 'Cardboard' aesthetic is difficult to negate

## Class Activity #1
Pick 1 or 2 example and build with your craft materials and servo. Spend time understanding the mechanism (how they work) and their application (how you can use them). Experiment with sizes, placements of parts, scale etc. Spend about ~1.5 hours
