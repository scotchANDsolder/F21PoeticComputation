# Notes on Construction

Your machines can be constructed using many different types of materials

## Using Acrlyics (Plastics)
**Pros**
- Sturdy constructions
- Viable for precision parts like gears
- Easy to manipulate, glue and join

**Cons**
- Need access to a laser cutter
- Requires precision measurement and design
- Difficult to manipulate, glue and join

### Laser Cutter Usage: Epilog 50 Watt 
- Maximum Thickness of material: 1/4 inch (6mm)
- Laser Cutter Bed Size: 24 X 18 inches
 - Approved Materials: Paper, cardboar, acrylics, wood

- Nylon Screws (Easy to work with): https://www.homedepot.com/b/Hardware-Fasteners-Screws/Nylon/N-5yc1vZc2b0Z1z1r7er


## Using Cardboard
**Pros**
- Great way to prototype and test ideas
- Cheap and easily accessible material
- Easy to manipulate, glue and join

**Cons**
- Difficult to get precision (but this might not be a downside)
- 'Cardboard' aesthetic is difficult to resolve

## Class Activity #1
Pick 1 or 2 examples from above and build with your craft materials and servo. Spend time understanding the mechanism (how they work) and their application (how you can use them). Experiment with sizes, placements of parts, scale etc. Spend about ~1.5 hours

## Important points to keep in Mind
- How is the servo connected to your mechanism? 
- Do you have mounting holes for all your components?
- How are you putting the parts together? Glues, screws, slits etc.?
- What other materials are you going to use?
